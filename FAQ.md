# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) üå≥

## General Questions

### What is Tree App?
Tree App is a private family sharing platform that allows you to create intimate family "trees" and "branches" to share precious memories, milestones, and moments with only your closest loved ones. Think of it as a completely private social network designed specifically for families.

### How is Tree different from other social platforms?
- **Complete Privacy**: No public posts ever - everything is private by default
- **Family-Centered**: Organized around family trees and branches, not individual profiles  
- **Email Integration**: Send photos/videos directly via email to create instant memories
- **Milestone Tracking**: Special posts for celebrating important family moments
- **Person-Centric**: Each family member can have their own "tree" with organized content

### Who can see my content?
Only family members you personally invite can see your content. There are no public posts, no discovery features, and no way for strangers to find your family's memories.

## Getting Started

### How do I create my first family tree?
1. Sign up with your email address
2. Complete the onboarding process
3. Create your first family tree (represents your family unit)
4. Add branches within your tree for different topics (like "Kids", "Vacations", "Milestones")
5. Invite family members via email

### What are Trees vs Branches?
- **Trees**: Your family's home base - represents a family unit or person
- **Branches**: Specific topics within a tree (e.g., "Emma's First Year", "Family Vacations", "Grandparents")

### How do I invite family members?
1. Go to your tree or branch settings
2. Click "Invite Members"
3. Enter their email address and select their role (Member, Admin, or Owner)
4. Add a personal message
5. They'll receive an email invitation with a secure link

## Email-to-Memory Feature

### How does email-to-memory work?
Each user gets a unique email address. When you send photos, videos, or audio files to this address, they automatically become "leaves" (posts) in your family tree. The email subject becomes the caption, and attachments are uploaded to secure cloud storage.

### What file types can I email?
- **Photos**: JPG, PNG, HEIC, GIF
- **Videos**: MP4, MOV, AVI
- **Audio**: MP3, WAV, M4A
- **Documents**: PDF (coming soon)

### Can I send to multiple trees at once?
Yes! You can email content that gets shared across multiple family trees, especially useful for grandparents sharing with different branches of the family.

## Roles and Permissions

### What are the different user roles?

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **Owner** | Full control - manage members, settings, delete tree/branch |
| **Admin** | Manage members, moderate content, configure settings |
| **Member** | Create posts, comment, like, participate in discussions |

### Can I change someone's role after inviting them?
Yes, Owners and Admins can update member roles through the branch/tree settings.

### What happens if I leave a tree or branch?
You lose access to that content immediately. If you're the Owner, you need to transfer ownership to another member first.

## Content and Features

### What are "Leaves"?
Leaves are individual posts/memories in your family tree. They can contain:
- Text content and captions
- Photos, videos, and audio
- Milestone markers (first words, birthdays, achievements)
- Comments and reactions from family
- AI-enhanced captions and tags

### What are Milestones?
Special posts that celebrate important family moments:
- **Physical**: First steps, walking, crawling
- **Communication**: First words, sentences
- **Social**: First friends, school events
- **Academic**: Graduation, achievements
- **Celebration**: Birthdays, holidays
- **Family**: New siblings, moving homes

### Can I edit or delete posts?
Yes, you can edit your own posts. Deleting depends on your role - members can delete their own posts, while admins can moderate any content.

### How does AI enhancement work?
The app can automatically generate captions and tags for your photos and videos, helping organize your memories and making them easier to find later.

## Privacy and Security

### How secure is my family's data?
- **Database-level Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) ensures complete data isolation
