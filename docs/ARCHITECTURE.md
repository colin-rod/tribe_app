# Tribe App Architecture

## Core Concept: Person-Centric Family Memory Management

The Tribe app is designed around **person-centric trees** where each tree represents an individual person (child, family member, etc.) and families can share memories across multiple connected trees.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented Features

#### Email Integration System
- **SendGrid webhook processing** with comprehensive media support
- **Base64 attachment handling** with automatic Supabase Storage upload
- **Multi-format support**: Photos (JPG, PNG, HEIC), Videos (MP4, MOV), Audio (MP3, WAV)
- **Smart content processing** with hashtag extraction and email formatting
- **Person-specific email routing**: `person-{treeId}@domain.com` format
- **Legacy email support**: `u-{userId}@domain.com` still functional

#### Tree and Branch System
- **Person-centric trees**: Each tree represents an individual person
- **Tree management permissions**: `managed_by` array allows parents to manage children's trees
- **Cross-tree branch sharing**: Branches can connect multiple person trees
- **Email address mapping**: Each tree can have dedicated email addresses

#### Media Processing Pipeline
- **Automatic media upload** from email attachments to Supabase Storage
- **Organized storage structure**: `/email-attachments/{userId}/{emailId}/`
- **Multi-media support**: Images, videos, audio with proper MIME type handling
- **Error handling**: Partial success for batch uploads, comprehensive logging

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **User roles**: Owner, Admin, Member with granular permissions
- **Tree-level permissions**: Users can manage multiple trees (parent ‚Üí children)
- **Branch-level access control**: Fine-grained sharing permissions
- **Cross-tree security**: Proper validation for multi-tree operations

#### Real-time Features
- **Supabase subscriptions** for live updates
- **Real-time notifications** for new content
- **Live comments and reactions** on family memories
- **Instant synchronization** across devices

### üîÑ Partially Implemented Features

#### Person-Centric Database Schema
- **Trees table enhanced** with person fields (`person_name`, `person_birth_date`, `managed_by`, `relationships`)
- **Cross-tree connections** via `tree_branch_connections` table
- **Email routing** via `tree_email_addresses` table
- **Migration completed** but UI still family-centric in some areas

#### User Interface
- **Dashboard supports** tree switching but lacks unified parent dashboard
- **LeafCard displays** person attribution but limited cross-tree visualization
- **Branch creation** works cross-tree but UI could be more intuitive
- **Tree management** functional but could be streamlined for parents

### ‚ùå Planned But Not Yet Implemented

#### Advanced AI Features
- **Face recognition**: Auto-identify people in photos for smart routing
- **Content categorization**: AI-powered tagging and organization
- **Smart suggestions**: Proactive memory prompts based on patterns

}
```

### API Architecture

#### Email Processing Flow

```
1. Email sent to person-sarah@domain.com
2. SendGrid Parse API forwards to /api/webhooks/sendgrid
3. Extract tree ID from email address
4. Validate user can manage target tree
5. Process attachments and upload to Supabase Storage
6. Create leaf with person context
7. Notify family members of new content
```

#### Authentication & Authorization

```typescript
// Route Protection Middleware
async function authenticateRequest(req: NextRequest) {
  const { user } = await getUser(req)
  if (!user) throw new AuthError('Authentication required')
  return user
}

// Tree Management Authorization
async function canManageTree(userId: string, treeId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const tree = await getTree(treeId)
  return tree.managed_by.includes(userId) || tree.created_by === userId
}

// Cross-Tree Branch Access
async function canAccessBranch(userId: string, branchId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // Check if user can access any tree connected to this branch
  const connections = await getTreeBranchConnections(branchId)
  return connections.some(conn => canManageTree(userId, conn.tree_id))
}
```

### Storage Architecture

#### Media Storage (Supabase Storage)

```
media/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email-attachments/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {userId}/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {emailId}/
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ photo1.jpg
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video1.mp4
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ audio1.mp3
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-uploads/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {userId}/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {leafId}/
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ media files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ profile-images/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {userId}/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ avatar.jpg
```

#### Database Optimizations

```sql
-- Indexes for Performance
CREATE INDEX idx_trees_managed_by ON trees USING GIN (managed_by);
CREATE INDEX idx_tree_branch_connections_tree_id ON tree_branch_connections (tree_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tree_branch_connections_branch_id ON tree_branch_connections (branch_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tree_email_addresses_active ON tree_email_addresses (email_address) WHERE is_active = true;
CREATE INDEX idx_leaves_tree_id ON leaves (tree_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_leaf_assignments_branch_id ON leaf_assignments (branch_id);

-- Row Level Security Policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own trees" ON trees
  FOR ALL USING (created_by = auth.uid() OR auth.uid() = ANY(managed_by));

CREATE POLICY "Users can access connected branches" ON branches
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM tree_branch_connections tbc
      JOIN trees t ON tbc.tree_id = t.id
      WHERE tbc.branch_id = branches.id
      AND (t.created_by = auth.uid() OR auth.uid() = ANY(t.managed_by))
    )
  );
```

## User Experience Architecture

### Parent User Journey

1. **Account Creation**: Parent signs up with primary email
2. **Tree Creation**: Creates trees for family members (children, spouse, etc.)
3. **Email Setup**: Generates person-specific email addresses
4. **Content Sharing**: Sends/forwards photos to person-specific emails
5. **Memory Management**: Organizes content into branches across family trees
6. **Family Engagement**: Invites extended family to appropriate branches

### Content Flow Architecture

```
