# Project Management Guide

## Overview

This document outlines how to manage development of the Tribe app's person-centric architecture transformation and ongoing feature development.

## Documentation Structure

### Core Planning Documents
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Person-centric tree model and technical architecture
- **[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)** - Phased development plan with timelines and success metrics
- **[CURRENT_STATE_ANALYSIS.md](./CURRENT_STATE_ANALYSIS.md)** - Gap analysis between current and target architecture

### Feature Tracking
- **GitHub Issues** - Individual features, bugs, and technical tasks
- **GitHub Projects** - Sprint planning and progress tracking
- **Issue Templates** - Standardized templates for consistent issue creation

**Monday: Sprint Planning**
1. Review previous sprint outcomes
2. Prioritize backlog items based on:
   - User impact and value
   - Technical dependencies
   - Resource availability
   - Phase progression
3. Commit to sprint goals and issues
4. Break down large issues into subtasks

**Tuesday-Friday: Development**
- Daily standups (async via GitHub comments)
- Active development and code review
- Continuous testing and integration

### Week 2: Execution & Review  
**Monday-Thursday: Development**
- Focus on completing committed work
- Address blockers and dependencies
- Prepare demos and documentation

**Friday: Sprint Review & Retrospective**
1. Demo completed features
2. Review sprint metrics and goals
3. Identify process improvements
4. Plan next sprint priorities
