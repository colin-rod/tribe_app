## üêõ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### Issue 1: "Infinite recursion detected in policy"
**Cause:** RLS policies not updated
**Solution:** Run the latest migration file

### Issue 2: User can't see created circles
**Cause:** Circle membership not created
**Solution:** Check `circle_members` table has entry

### Issue 3: Categories not loading
**Cause:** `circle_categories` table empty
**Solution:** Ensure migration inserted default categories

### Issue 4: Dashboard shows "No user found"
**Cause:** Server/client session mismatch
