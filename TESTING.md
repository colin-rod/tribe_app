**SQL Queries to Run:**
```sql
-- Check circles table
SELECT id, name, type, privacy, category, is_discoverable, auto_approve_members 
FROM circles 
WHERE created_by = 'your-user-id';

-- Check circle memberships  
SELECT cm.*, c.name as circle_name
FROM circle_members cm
JOIN circles c ON cm.circle_id = c.id
WHERE cm.user_id = 'your-user-id';

- [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Mobile Chrome (Android)

**Key Features to Test:**
- [ ] Circle creation form layout
- [ ] Dashboard responsive design
- [ ] Button interactions
- [ ] Form submissions

### Test Case 12: Mobile Responsiveness

## üêõ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### Issue 1: "Infinite recursion detected in policy"
**Cause:** RLS policies not updated
**Solution:** Run the latest migration file

### Issue 2: User can't see created circles
**Cause:** Circle membership not created
**Solution:** Check `circle_members` table has entry

### Issue 3: Categories not loading
**Cause:** `circle_categories` table empty
**Solution:** Ensure migration inserted default categories

### Issue 4: Dashboard shows "No user found"
**Cause:** Server/client session mismatch
**Solution:** Dashboard is now client-side, should work
